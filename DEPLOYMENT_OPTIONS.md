# üöÄ Deployment Options for RAG Lawyer Chatbot

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important: Streamlit Cloud Limitation**

**Streamlit Cloud does NOT support Ollama** because:
- Ollama requires local installation and running services
- Streamlit Cloud is a serverless platform
- No access to local system services

## üéØ **Deployment Options:**

### 1. **Local Development (Current Setup)**
‚úÖ **Works perfectly** with your current setup:
- Ollama for embeddings
- Groq API for LLM
- FAISS vector store

**To run locally:**
```bash
# Start Ollama
ollama serve

# Run your app
streamlit run frontend.py
```

### 2. **Alternative Cloud Platforms**

#### **Option A: Railway**
- Supports Docker containers
- Can install Ollama in container
- More control over environment

#### **Option B: Google Cloud Run**
- Containerized deployment
- Can run Ollama in container
- Pay-per-use pricing

#### **Option C: AWS EC2**
- Full server control
- Can install and run Ollama
- More expensive but full control

#### **Option D: Hugging Face Spaces**
- Free tier available
- Supports custom environments
- May support Ollama with custom setup

### 3. **Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
Keep your current setup for local development and create a cloud version:

1. **Local Version**: Use Ollama (current setup)
2. **Cloud Version**: Use cloud-based embeddings (OpenAI/HuggingFace)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Local development**: Fully working with Ollama
- ‚ùå **Streamlit Cloud**: Not compatible (Ollama limitation)
- ‚úÖ **Code quality**: Production-ready
- ‚úÖ **All dependencies**: Properly configured

## üéâ **Recommendation:**
**Keep your current setup for local development!** It's perfect for:
- Personal use
- Development and testing
- Local demonstrations
- Learning and experimentation

For cloud deployment, consider the alternative platforms mentioned above.
